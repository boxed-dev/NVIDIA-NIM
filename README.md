# NVIDIA NIM and Retrieval-Augmented Question-Answering Pipeline

This code demonstrates how to use the NVIDIA NIM to build a question-answering system. The system fetches a web page, embeds its content using NVIDIA Embeddings, and then uses a retrieval-based question-answering approach to answer queries based on the embedded content.

## Prerequisites

Before running this code, make sure you have the following dependencies installed:

- `langchain_nvidia_ai_endpoints`
- `langchain-community`
- `langchain-text-splitters`
- `faiss-cpu`

You can install them using pip:

```bash
pip install langchain_nvidia_ai_endpoints langchain-community langchain-text-splitters faiss-cpu
```

Additionally, you need to set your NVIDIA API key as an environment variable named `NVIDIA_API_KEY`. This is necessary to authenticate with the NVIDIA Generative AI Microservices.

## Code Explanation

1. **Import required libraries**: The code imports the necessary libraries and modules, including `NVIDIAEmbeddings` and `ChatNVIDIA` from `langchain_nvidia_ai_endpoints`, `WebBaseLoader` from `langchain_community.document_loaders`, and other utilities.

2. **Load web page content**: The code uses `WebBaseLoader` to fetch the content of a web page (in this case, "https://nvidianews.nvidia.com/news/generative-ai-microservices-for-developers/").

3. **Set up NVIDIA API key**: The code retrieves the NVIDIA API key from the Google Colab environment (if running in Colab) and sets it as an environment variable.

4. **Initialize NVIDIA Embeddings**: The code creates an instance of `NVIDIAEmbeddings`, which is used to embed the web page content.

5. **Split and embed documents**: The code splits the web page content into smaller chunks using `RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter` and embeds these chunks using the `FAISS` vector store and the initialized `NVIDIAEmbeddings`.

6. **Initialize NVIDIA ChatNVIDIA model**: The code creates an instance of `ChatNVIDIA` with the "mistral_7b" model.

7. **Define hypothetical answer generation**: The code defines a template and a chain for generating hypothetical answers to questions using the `ChatNVIDIA` model.

8. **Define retriever chain**: The code defines a chain `hyde_retriever` that generates a hypothetical document based on the question and retrieves relevant documents from the vector store using the hypothetical document as a query.

9. **Define answer generation chain**: The code defines a template and a chain `answer_chain` for generating actual answers to questions based on the retrieved context documents.

10. **Define final question-answering chain**: The code defines a final chain `final_chain` that combines the `hyde_retriever` and `answer_chain` chains to answer questions by first retrieving relevant documents and then generating answers based on those documents.

11. **Run the question-answering system**: The code demonstrates the usage of the `final_chain` by streaming the answer to the question "Tell me about NVIDIA NIM".

## Usage

To use this code, follow these steps:

1. Install the required dependencies.
2. Set your NVIDIA API key as an environment variable named `NVIDIA_API_KEY`.
3. Run the code.
4. When prompted, enter your question, and the system will generate an answer based on the retrieved context.

**Note:** This code is designed to work with the NVIDIA Generative AI Microservices, which may require a paid subscription or credits. Additionally, the performance and accuracy of the question-answering system will depend on the quality and relevance of the embedded web page content.
